# PPL extra
This is the extra section of Principle of Programming Language course at HCMUT.

Given the **initial code**, there are 3 phases:

+ [x]  Phase 1: Generate JVM code for binary expression with + operator.
+ [x]  Phase 2: Generate MIPS code for the same inputs of phase 1. Implementing the algorithm to assign registers and manage variables is required in this phase.
+ [ ]  Phase 3: Extend the solution of phase 2 such that it can generate MIPS code for the **ZCode** language (which is specified in the normal PPL course).
